This repo contains all content, files, materials and more to run your own SantosRP server **no support will be given beyond what is already shown in the files.**
~~As of 4/10/2024 the gamemode fully works with no issues as long as you follow the setup instructions correctly.~~

### Setup Help
 All setup information can be found in sv_config.lua

### Workshop/Materials Setup 
The previous linked workshop content has been taken down although, I am sure you can look up SantosRP content in the Garry's Mod workshop and find something that will suit your needs. Just extract the workshop content and figure out what it is you need exactly.
